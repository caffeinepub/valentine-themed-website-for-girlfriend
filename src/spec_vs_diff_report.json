  "summary": "REQ-19 appears implemented by restructuring ClosingSection to stack the Yes button and a separate No-button container below it, while retaining dodging behavior via randomized transforms inside the container. REQ-20 appears implemented by reducing Memory Lane captions to 5 in content and enforcing a 5-image cap in MemoryLaneSection. REQ-21 appears implemented by removing the playlist section from ValentinePage rendering. No clear unrequested features are evidenced beyond what is necessary for these changes, though diff truncation limits verification of site-wide playlist removal.",
